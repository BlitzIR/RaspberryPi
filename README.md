Raspberry Pis also work with breadboards. When male ends are connected to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, outputs and other reactions can be obtained. However, receiving an input/output depends on what is wired or constructed.

The breadboard shown here is a simple vending machine, more about the project [here](https://github.com/BlitzIR/BreadboardVendingMachine).
