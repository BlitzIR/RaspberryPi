GPIO Pins: The GPIO pins allow for user's to work with technology not present on the Raspberry Pi. These can include electrical and electronic connections through breadboards and other such devices.

MicroSD Card Slot: This slot is under all of the input output (I/O) connection side of the Raspberry Pi. This is a quick way to insert a microSD card so the computer can have storage. The card must be at least 8 gigabytes in size.

USB-C Power Supply: The USB-C power supply gives the device power. A USB-C cable can have a wall plug on the other end of it. Ensure that the output voltage of the charger is 5 volts and the input current is at least 2.5 volts.

Micro HDMI Ports: These micro HDMI ports are for video output. If connecting to a monitor with standard HDMI, a micro HDMI to HDMI cable is needed.

Camera Connector: This is a connection for the Raspberry Pi camera module shown in the diagram below.

3.5mm Audio Jack: Allows for connecting audio jack connectors for sound output.

USB 2.0 Ports: Made for connecting USB 2.0 compatible devices.

USB 3.0 Ports: Made for connecting USB 3.0 compatible devices, is backward compatible with USB 2.0.

Gigabit Ethernet Port: This is for a wired Ethernet connection so the computer can connect to a network.

CPU: Known as the "brain" of the computer. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) does all of the hard work, such as responding to commands (typing, clicking) and computing thousands of processes to respond to the user's commands. The featured model (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B) has a 1.5 GHz CPU, which is not very powerful on a traditional desktop but is plenty for this tiny machine. 

RAM: Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage for the device. It holds active data so the computer can store and expel it.

Speaker: This speaker can be connected to the Raspberry Pi to allow sound output.

Color Sensor: The Lego Spike color sensor can detect colors.

Temperature Sensor: This low wattage tool can detect temperatures. It's essentially a thermometer.

Powered Lego Wheel: This Lego wheel is not from the kit. However, it is somewhat similar to the PiWheel which is designed for Raspberry Pi. However, the Lego wheel is slower in comparison.

Camera Module: This 8 megapixel camera is designed for the Raspberry Pi. 

Wii Remote: This is a Wii Remote.

NeoPixel Stick: The neopixel stick consists of LEDs that can display colors depending on how the user sets it up.

Raspberry Pi Build Hat: This device can connect to the 40 pin GPIO to allow for additional Raspberry Pi connection.

UltraSonic Distance Sensor: This device measures distance by producing ultrasonic waves. It measures the distance by measuring the time it takes from a wave to hit and object and return to the sensor.

20-Pin Connector: This is for extra connections.

Raspberry Pis also work with breadboards. When male ends are connected to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, outputs and other reactions can be obtained. However, receiving an input/output depends on what is wired or constructed.

The breadboard shown here is a simple vending machine, you can learn more about the project [here](https://github.com/BlitzIR/BreadboardVendingMachine).
